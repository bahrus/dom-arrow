<div id=start>Hello</div>
<p>
    Euclid [described](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry)) a line as "breathless length" which "lies equally with respect to the points on itself"; 
    he introduced several postulates as basic unprovable properties from which he constructed all of geometry, 
    which is now called Euclidean geometry to avoid confusion with other geometries which 
    have been introduced since the end of the 19th century (such as non-Euclidean, projective and affine geometry).

<div id=end>Goodbye</div>
